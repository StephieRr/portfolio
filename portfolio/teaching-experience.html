        <h2 class="heading-7">Teaching Experience</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-10">2015 I had the opportunity to teach 2nd Grade art and science and mentor children with learning difficulties. Here I introduce some of the activities that were most appreciated by the kids, their parents and the board of directives. </p>

        <h1 class="heading-15">Personalized learning</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-13">A highlight during my teaching phase was tutoring a child with a complex learning difficulty. My task consisted of finding ways to develop their numeracy and literacy skills in non traditional ways. We focused on finding books they were interested in reading and found that they were strongly inclined to read books about science experiments. I then developed a scavenger hunt in the library in which they could read clues to ultimately find their own copy of a new favorite book. These clues contained material we had been working on previously. <br>Then we tried out some of the experiments from the new book; one of them being the egg in the bottle trick. This was a good way to engage the child in reading something they were interested in, interpreting what they read in order to follow specific steps of an experimented, and it only worked well once it was done correctly. Finally, it was an excellent opportunity to learn about exterior and interior air pressure.<br><br>Another large part of our sessions consisted of learning how to read an analog clock. An analog clock is a very complex tool for some kids who struggle to find the relationship between the numbers on the clock and their meaning (11 also meaning 55 min, half an hour being referred to with a 6, a whole consisting of 12, etc). A clock seemed to be an excellent object to learn about a large set of numerical and arithmetic skills. This inspired a future project of mine which can be seen in the link below. </p>

        <p class="paragraph-13">During my art classes, I planned a series of lessons on artists and helped the children create their own version of the artist&#x27;s style. At the end of the 6 part series, they all created an original piece and chose their favorite painting created over the month to exhibit at their own small art installation. <br>Every lesson included biographical background of the artist, fun facts about the artist and an overview of the techniques the artist would use and the opportunity to try their own hand using those techniques and shapes. <br>The artist we focused on were: Paul Klee, Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh, Johannes Vermeer, Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet. </p>

        <p class="paragraph-13">To learn about ecosystems included in our curriculum, I brought cupcakes so the kids could decorate them and present to the class what ecosystem they created on their cupcake. Even though it was a bit of a mess, the kids were enthusiastic and excited to think about all the possible places they could create. </p>

        <p class="paragraph-14">On occasions I&#x27;d bring my camera to class and create short films with the kids. They were allowed to handle it if we could manage to stay organized enough for it, and they were encouraged to come up with ideas for stories. For mother&#x27;s day we created a beautiful film in which each child shared a personal message for their mom. We also made aprons for each mom, and the children were allowed to use my sewing machine in moments when I was able to supervise an individual. We broke a few needles, but the children felt empowered by being allowed to use these tools. </p>
