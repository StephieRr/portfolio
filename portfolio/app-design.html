        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-6">This project was motivated by my experience working with children with learning difficulties. One child in particular, had an undiagnosed condition even after several assessments from different specialists. I was not asked to follow any curriculum with them. I was only tasked to find ways to engage this child in reading and developing a better sense of mathematical concepts. <br><br>I quickly noticed how interpreting the time on an analog clock was very challenging for this kid who was already in 5th grade. It was a very unconventional case, but it was rewarding and allowed space for creative thinking. Although it seems obvious to me now, it was then when <strong>I realized how complex that clock can be</strong>. It serves as an example to learn about:<br>‍<strong>     •</strong> fractions (half an hour, quarter hour, etc)<br><strong>     •</strong> interesting relationships of a whole consisting of 12 parts in which a half refers to 6 as opposed to the common way of seeing 5 being a half (2,5 hours).<br><br>We built our own model of a clock we could manipulate and used a tablet to experiment with the best ways to learn about concepts mentioned earlier. The clock model helped for easy visualization of different times and easy manipulation of the hands. But this child kept preferring the tablet where we could easily paint fractions of the clock and move these fractions around to compare them to other fractions. This way we learned how half an hour can be calculated from any point in the clock, which wasn&#x27;t intuitive for this child. </p>

          <h1>Results and Final Thoughts</h1>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <p>Considering the time frame, I think our final product was a strong first iteration for this project. It was well received by the professor team and we were encouraged to submit it to the RESNA design challenges. Sadly, the deadlines had passed by then. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A further iteration would do a better job at spacing learning by adding a calendar to keep track of constant progress. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>It would be helpful to have an initial questionnaire or quiz for parents or children to provide input as to what the child struggles with most. It also should include a better feedback loop for the developers to track if goals are being achieved. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The games also need further development as some of them were simplified because of time constraints. The first game, for example, would be complimented by a scrollable scene in which the child can scroll over a bar that is a timeline of the 24 hours in a day. The child could then see typical activities happening during a specific time and the relationship of the sun&#x27;s position. </p>
